# Final Project Ideas for GEOG 422

I am _thinking_ that my final project for this class will be something more along the lines of a remote sensing script. After talking to companies I could 
see myself working for long-term, I think that is the most important skill that I do not know, but should consider learning. What **better** environment is there
to do that in than for a class?

I plan on using ~~LiDAR~~, actually Landsat or Maxar data would be better, to see if I can script some sort of machine-learning or automated script to classify spectral signatures. But
there is a concern that could be a little too advanced. Here is a list of things I will need to look for. 

1. I will need to be familiar with ESRI resources on remote sensing
2. Imagery data that is free, but also easily accessible
  * Maxar has an awesome open data program that I could use, but otherwise, Landsat images will work fine. 
  * On that note, I here are the links to [Maxar](https://www.maxar.com/open-data) and [USGS EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/)
3. Honestly, some youtube references will be helpful, so I should try looking [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqirs04EccA)
