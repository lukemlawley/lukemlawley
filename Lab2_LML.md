# Final Project Ideas for GEOG 422

I am _thinking_ that my final project for this class will be something more along the lines of a remote sensing script. After talking to companies I could 
see myself working for long-term, I think that is the most important skill that I do not know, but should consider learning. What **better** environment is there
to do that in than for a class.
